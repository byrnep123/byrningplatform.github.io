                What is it about “Leadership” that solicits so much attention and opinion? How can a single word inspire countless business books, blogs and consultancies yet be so elusive in the workplace? It’s odd, with so many employees aspiring for leadership positions you’d expect a surplus of great leaders in organizations. In reality, we have such a hard time finding leaders that mythical stories of great cultures and achievements spread when one actually emerges. We’ve all heard that if you are serious about accelerating your career, you need to focus on your results; and, if you’ve like me, you’ve spent late nights polishing a presentation or extra time simplifying code to ensure your deliverables are flawless. Ask yourself, honestly, did that presentation or patch really change your career trajectory? If a position in Leadership is our goal, then will focusing on individual results demonstrate an ability to lead others? To achieve Leadership as a noun we must embrace Leadership as a verb.

                <br><br>
                I think Leadership gets so much aspirational attention because it is something we’ve all experienced, good and bad. We all know how good leadership makes us feel: relevant, needed and impactful. Some of us have felt the impact of poor leadership: disenfranchised, underutilized and replaceable. Put simply, great leaders make employees feel valued, valued employees get results and results get noticed. In the context of career growth, leadership is more than managing teams (although that’s often where it starts), leadership is the driving factor that determines the impact of our projects, the promulgation of our ideas, and the depth to which we each reach our career potential. 
                <br><br>
                There is a natural arc in almost every career trajectory: We start with a project assignments where we first contribute to and eventually lead teams; As we deliver results and grow in experience, our subject matter expertise begins to influence organizational thoughts and direction; Eventually, our ability to contribute, influence and engage reaches the limits of our talent, work ethic and relationships until our career momentum slows and stabilizes. Ultimately, careers plateau when individuals stop building on their potential and settle into success. 

                <br><br>
                The arc of a leader’s growth is similar (and arguably correlates) to this common career narrative: we start with ownership of a product (Product Leadership), expand to influence ideas (People Leadership) and are ultimately bound by our ability to extract and optimize the potential we’ve been gifted (Personal Leadership). Growth across these three Leadership foci changes trajectories until an individual’s career potential aligns with their career reality.

                Often, the reward for successfully delivering results through effective Project Leadership is additional responsibility and larger assignments. Eventually, Project Leadership puts us into roles where analysis of the data is only part of the strategic story. In these situations, Thought Leadership becomes critical. The deliverable in Thought Leadership is not a result you see on a scorecard, it is the shared belief that future results are possible. Successful Thought Leaders contrast the realities of today with a Vision for tomorrow in a way that creates Alignment between teams and unifies direction. With clear Vision of the future, and Alignment in each member’s contribution to the team, the Thought Leader focuses on team Empowerment by inspiring others to take ownership of the effort and achieve the result. The sign of an effective Thought Leader is a great idea that everyone believes is their own.

                While successful team projects and great organizational ideas go a long way to drive careers up the corporate ladder, the future potential of any leader is ultimately limited by the individual’s talent, drive and potential. No matter your impact, self-defeating attitudes, failure to stay current with trends & technology and political blind spots will damper your career trajectory. Personal growth is by nature an individual act and, while we can’t outsource personal development, we can leverage the Pattern of Practice to build effective habits and ward off career sludge. This journey starts with an audit of our personal Values against our personal actions. Understanding who we think we are against the realities of how we show up creates a dissonance through which change can occur. These cracks between our identity and our actions can be fortified with Structured practices (checklists, accountability partners, personal objectives) that drive improved behavior. With Value gaps identified, and Structure to intentionally practice, the gap between intent and outcome closes until these new behaviors become Habits and ultimately part of who we are. There’s a point in everyone’s career where the results you achieve will be weighed against the baggage you carry – continuous growth through Personal Leadership lightens the load.

                <br><br>
                With the help of caring mentors, The Pattern led to insightful conversations, practical applications, and an
                approachable method I could apply even when I lacked natural ability. There is a distinct positive correlation
                between career trajectory and personal growth. If we are willing to face our failures, observe how others overcome
                the same challenges, reflect on how we can show up differently, and then apply intentional changes regularly, we will
                grow as people and professionals. (I know I have.)
                <br><br>
                This practice of observation, reflection, and application is the soil on which the Byrning Platform is built. At its
                foundation, the Byrning Platform is the simple belief that success is a symptom of repeated effort to intentionally
                improve as a leader.

                If we believe that Leadership Growth is indeed correlated to Career Growth, then focused effort to improve our leadership ability will also improve opportunities for career advancement. The Byrning Platform puts intentional focus on Project, Thought and Personal Leadership growth because leadership is the structure upon which careers, regardless of industry or position, are built. Structure requires action to become success and, while paradigms and models are great for appreciating the world, these tools are lousy for generating experiential opportunities. We need practices to actively bind knowledge of leadership principles with actions that develop career opportunities. Next time we explore some of these key experiences to enable career advancement.

                Thanks for being on the Platform – Let’s make a difference.
