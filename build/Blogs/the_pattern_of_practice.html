                Personal Leadership
              </h2>
              <p class="text-lg text-gray-700  dark:text-slate-200 mb-6">
                If you’ve had the chance to read the introductory post to The Byrning Platform series, then you’re familiar with
                my belief that ‘the office’ is both the ultimate growth environment and an incomparable enabler of career
                opportunity. I believe in the power of the office to change lives, specifically in Black and underrepresented
                communities, because I’ve both witnessed and personally experienced the transformations. 
                <br><br>
                In my story, enablement came through two distinct forms of introductions. First, the office offered proximity to
                inspiring leaders who were willing to share advice, council and encouragement. Second, and more personal, the office
                forced me to face the blind spots, biases, and performance gaps that hindered career advancement and stifled personal
                growth. The corporate crucible changes lives with the dual offering of professional proximity and personal growth
                opportunity.
                <br><br>
                If we know where to look, the office provides both examples of success to aspire towards and the arena to practice
                the pursuit. Unfortunately, the path to professional enlightenment is often unclear and, for Black and
                underrepresented Americans, the journey is uneven. The fact is we’re not all handed the same Office Playbook for
                Personal Development during new hire orientation.
                <br><br>
                For some, with the right connections, pedigree, network, and appearance, the secrets of office excellence are shared
                freely. If you’re anything like me, a small-town kid who liked math, raised pigs, and knew nothing of office politics,
                the first years navigating the corporate jungle were challenging.
                <br><br>
                In my story, momentum grew as I discovered how to transform failures and overlooks into lessons and learning. This
                personal pivot started with a question: ‘How can I learn-to-learn from my peers' successes and my own mistakes?’ Over
                the years, with the help of patient mentors (Cathy Tedesco, Kevin Crawford & Kenny Hsu) and excellent material on
                Emotional Intelligence by Kevin Bush from Teams and Leaders, I began to unpack hard truths from my corporate
                experience.

                A Pattern of Practice Emerges
              </h2>
              <p class="text-lg text-gray-700  dark:text-slate-200 mb-6">
                In studying the ample examples where my career was going wrong, a Pattern of Practice emerged that began to help
                things go right:
              </p>
              <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 m-12 text-lg">
                <li>I learned to start with a Willingness to Observe the actions and behaviors of myself and others.</li>
                <li>Develop the Patience to Reflect on how behavioral differences drive disparate outcomes.</li>
                <li>Gather the Courage to Apply learned behaviors and leap toward new experiences.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700  dark:text-slate-200 mb-6">
              I’ve come to believe that, more than any degree, network connection, or experience, the Pattern of Practice above
              offers the greatest opportunity for individual insight and growth. The Pattern creates a flywheel of inevitable
              results, both small and large, if we are disciplined in its application.
            <br><br>
            When we deploy The Pattern in an office environment laden with influential leaders and ripe with opportunities for
            growth, we write our own Office Playbook for Personal Development. The pattern gives us the power to change.

            <section class="mb-12 m-12">
              <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900  dark:text-slate-200 mb-4">
                Personal Reflections on the Pattern of Practice
              </h2>
              <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-slate-200 mb-6">
                For me, the Pattern of Practice has changed the way I look at leaders and problems in the workplace. I started to
                Observe what specific behaviors differentiated top talent from the rest, created space to Reflect on my own approach,
                and identified opportunities to Apply newly learned behaviors.
                <br><br>
                With the help of caring mentors, The Pattern led to insightful conversations, practical applications, and an
                approachable method I could apply even when I lacked natural ability. There is a distinct positive correlation
                between career trajectory and personal growth. If we are willing to face our failures, observe how others overcome
                the same challenges, reflect on how we can show up differently, and then apply intentional changes regularly, we will
                grow as people and professionals. (I know I have.)
                <br><br>
                This practice of observation, reflection, and application is the soil on which the Byrning Platform is built. At its
                foundation, the Byrning Platform is the simple belief that success is a symptom of repeated effort to intentionally
                improve as a leader.

                Building a Byrning Platform
              </h2>
              <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-slate-200 mb-6">
                Professional success is the result of leadership across three columns of change (Personal, Thought & Project) that
                together create a platform for courageous leaps in achievement. To climb the platform we must grow as leaders and
                take intentional steps to build our careers by harvesting feedback, creating personal development plans (or what I
                call a Career Sightline), building a generous network, finding caring mentors & advocates, sharing aspirations, and
                taking courageous leaps.
                <br><br>
                In our next article, I’ll introduce the Byrning Platform as a model for leadership philosophies and career practices
                that have been shared with me. We’ll then dive deeper into each of the columns of Project, Thought, and Personal
                Leadership with examples and anecdotes from leaders I’ve had the honor to learn from. Afterward, we’ll pivot into the
                practical steps each of us can take to climb the platform toward opportunities for courageous career leaps.
                <br><br>
                Recall, the motivation behind the Byrning Platform series is a desire to share office wisdom and generate
                opportunities for Black and underrepresented Americans to partake in the office experience. It is my hope that the
                stories, lessons, and learnings comprising the Byrning Platform create an Office Playbook for Personal Development
                that engenders equal office access for all.
                <br><br>
                With each article, I’ll publish a tool or tip sheet designed to help anyone facing career challenges. YOUR continued
                critical feedback, personal anecdotes, and practical applications all help improve the content. Please continue to
                send your thoughts on how we can apply the material and make a difference. Thanks for being on the platform – now
                let’s take the leap.
