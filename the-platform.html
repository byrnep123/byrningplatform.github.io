      <h1>Reflection at 35</h1>

  <p><strong>This month, I’ll turn 35…</strong></p>

  <p>As a semi-septuagenarian, I’ve reflected often on both life’s lessons and opportunities. In 2020, a year bringing more personal and global change than any other in my lifetime, this personal reflection has evoked myriad emotions. I’ve experienced the joys of becoming a father, the trials of relocating from Washington to Texas, the challenges of Covid-19, and the soul searching summoned by the Black Lives Matter movement. While building a new normal by working from home, changing countless diapers and connecting with family over FaceTime, I’ve come to appreciate an unexpected domain in my once daily routine: the familiar four walls of the office (think cubicles not comedy).</p>

  <p>More than a forum for business, the office provides an unrivaled education in camaraderie, mentorship, and opportunity that telecommuting can’t touch. In the office, I’ve had the blessings of mentorship and coaching from leaders including Cathy Tedesco, Jackee Mohl, Duran Gunter, Steve Emmert, Ken Aso, Bret Bolkcom, Brian Beaulac, Dalton Van Hatcher, and Ozan Unlu. These individuals have had a profound impact on my life and instilled a foundational respect for the power of Personal, Project, and Thought leadership.</p>

  <blockquote>
    I’ve made a point to pay their lessons forward, and as a manager, I take the responsibility to develop my teams and mentees personally. Truth be told, my favorite part of my job is that I get paid to help people grow and develop.
  </blockquote>

  <p>Up to now, I’ve unintentionally limited mentorships to those I meet in the office. As access to the office has been cut off, I’ve realized how important proximity is to opportunity. While I’ve always appreciated the proverbial wisdom behind “it’s not what you know, but who”, Covid has made me realize how essential the office is to connecting with mentors of personal discovery, career success, and future opportunity. Telecommuting not only changes our routines, it dramatically reduces our interactions and, consequently, our access to this life-changing knowledge.</p>

  <h2>Reflections on Black Lives Matter</h2>

  <p>In many ways, Covid-19 has helped me better appreciate the BLM movement. While the virus has certainly changed my daily commute (from a traffic-riddled rat race to a comfortable walk into our makeshift home office), BLM has highlighted the countless roadblocks and detours facing the Black community’s access to the career advancement and financial promise an office affords. We’ve all been challenged by Covid, but minorities have been, and will continue to be, disproportionately affected by unwritten systemic rules of access. There are fewer opportunities in minority communities and, predictably, fewer Black Americans in our offices.</p>

  <p>As a second-generation Irish Immigrant, I find myself both proud of my accomplishments and aware of my advantages. Further, as a white male, I recognize my path up the corporate ladder has been both figuratively and literally easier than Black men, and especially women, in my peer group. I want to be part of the generation that levels the playing field – part of a movement that recognizes the need to share the development opportunities elemental to the glass and girders of our corporate worlds.</p>

  <p>I believe that by expanding the corporate experience, the resulting proximity, combined with active outreach, will yield social and economic advancement. There’s magic in the office, it’s the ideal forum to craft tomorrow through development more impactful than any classroom, email, Zoom, or web post. Call it <em>Office-Osmosis</em>: if we give the underrepresented access to offices, and provide the opportunity to engage with and learn from leaders, lives will change.</p>

  <h2>The Gift of Permission</h2>

  <p>For years I’ve kicked around the idea of publishing career advice that has made a difference in my life. Today, the stakes are different. Just as we can’t ‘unsee’ the systemic differences facing the Black community, we also can’t sit by and not try to balance the scales. This post is both a small step in a long journey to make a difference, and a personal leap to share what I’ve learned so far.</p>

  <p>The gift I’ve given myself for my 35th Birthday is the gift of permission. Permission to advise, permission to promote, and permission to believe I can be part of the change that helps others enjoy the advantages the office has afforded me. I’m giving myself permission to champion the belief that success is a symptom of leadership across three columns of change (Personal, Thought & Team) built on a foundation of courageous opportunities.</p>

  <p>Over the next few weeks, I’ll be sharing my thoughts on Personal, Thought, and Team Leadership while providing tactical advice designed to help others courageously open doors and harvest growth opportunities. My goal is to provide a combination of accessible leadership philosophy and deployable tools that help advance access for underrepresented youth into fulfilling corporate careers. I’m calling the series <strong>The Byrning Platform</strong> to provide a forum for engagement and a reminder of the urgency facing this challenge.</p>

  <p><strong>Thank you for taking the leap -</strong></p>
