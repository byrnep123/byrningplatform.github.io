      <h2>The Pattern of Practice</h2>
      <p><strong>Posted on:</strong> October 11, 2020</p>
      
      <h1>The Byrning Platform Series</h1>

      <p>If you’ve had the chance to read the introductory post to The Byrning Platform series, then you’re familiar with my belief that <strong>‘the office’</strong> is both the ultimate growth environment and an incomparable enabler of career opportunity. I believe in the power of the office to change lives, specifically in Black and underrepresented communities, because I’ve both witnessed and personally experienced the transformations.</p>
    
      <p>In my story, enablement came through two distinct forms of introductions. First, the office offered proximity to inspiring leaders who were willing to share advice, counsel, and encouragement. Second, and more personal, the office forced me to face the blind spots, biases, and performance gaps that hindered career advancement and stifled personal growth. The corporate crucible changes lives with the dual offering of professional proximity and personal growth opportunity.</p>
    
      <p>If we know where to look, the office provides both examples of success to aspire toward and the arena to practice the pursuit. Unfortunately, the path to professional enlightenment is often unclear and, for Black and underrepresented Americans, the journey is uneven.</p>
    
      <h2>The Office Playbook for Personal Development</h2>
    
      <p>The fact is we’re not all handed the same Office Playbook for Personal Development during new hire orientation. For some, with the right connections, pedigree, network, and appearance, the secrets of office excellence are shared freely. If you’re anything like me, a small-town kid who liked math, raised pigs, and knew nothing of office politics, the first years navigating the corporate jungle were challenging.</p>
    
      <p>For many Black and underrepresented Americans, the journey never even begins. In my story, momentum grew as I discovered how to transform failures and overlooks into lessons and learning. This personal pivot started with a question, <em>‘How can I learn-to-learn from my peers' successes and my own mistakes?’</em></p>
    
      <p>With the help of patient mentors (Cathy Tedesco, Kevin Crawford, & Kenny Hsu) and excellent material on Emotional Intelligence offered by Kevin Bush from Teams and Leaders, I began to unpack hard truths from my experience in the corporate world. In studying the ample examples where my career was going wrong, a Pattern of Practice emerged that began to help things go right:</p>
    
      <ol>
        <li><strong>1)</strong> I learned to start with a <strong>Willingness to Observe</strong> the actions and behaviors of myself and others.</li>
        <li><strong>2)</strong> Develop the <strong>Patience to Reflect</strong> on how behavioral differences drive disparate outcomes.</li>
        <li><strong>3)</strong> Gather the <strong>Courage to Apply</strong> learned behaviors and leap toward new experiences.</li>
      </ol>
    
      <p>I’ve come to believe that, more than any degree, network connection, or experience, the Pattern of Practice above offers the greatest opportunity for individual insight and growth. The Pattern creates a flywheel of inevitable results, both small and large, if we are disciplined in its application. When we deploy The Pattern in an office environment laden with influential leaders and ripe with opportunities for growth, we write our own Office Playbook for Personal Development. The pattern gives us the power to change.</p>
    
      <blockquote>
        "The Pattern of Practice has changed the way I look at leaders and problems in the workplace."
      </blockquote>
    
      <p>For me, The Pattern of Practice has changed the way I look at leaders and problems in the workplace. I started to <strong>Observe</strong> what specific behaviors differentiated top talent from the rest of the pack, created space to <strong>Reflect</strong> on my own approach, and identified opportunities to <strong>Apply</strong> the newly learned behaviors. With the help of caring mentors, The Pattern led to insightful conversations, practical applications, and an approachable method I could apply even when I lacked natural ability.</p>
    
      <p>There is a distinctly positive correlation between career trajectory and personal growth. If we are willing to face our failures, observe how others overcome the same challenges, reflect on how we can show up differently, and then apply intentional changes regularly – we will grow as people and professionals (I know I have).</p>
    
      <h2>The Byrning Platform</h2>
    
      <p>This practice of observation, reflection, and application is the soil on which the Byrning Platform is built. At its foundation, the Byrning Platform is the simple belief that success is a symptom of repeated effort to intentionally improve as a leader. I believe professional success is the result of leadership across three columns of change: <strong>Personal, Thought, and Project</strong>, which together create a platform for courageous leaps in achievement.</p>
    
      <p>To climb the platform, we must grow as leaders and take intentional steps to build our careers by harvesting feedback, creating personal development plans (or what I call a Career Sightline), building a generous network, finding caring mentors & advocates, sharing aspirations, and taking courageous leaps.</p>
    
      <h2>What’s Next?</h2>
    
      <p>In our next article, I’ll introduce the Byrning Platform as a model for the leadership philosophies and career practices that have been shared with me. Following this high-level introduction, we’ll look closer at each of the columns of Project, Thought, and Personal Leadership with examples and anecdotes from leaders I’ve had the honor to learn from.</p>
    
      <p>Next, we’ll pivot into the practical steps each of us can take to climb the platform toward opportunities for courageous career leaps.</p>
    
      <p>Recall, the motivation behind the Byrning Platform series is a desire to share office wisdom and generate opportunities for Black and underrepresented Americans to partake in the office experience. It is my hope that the stories, lessons, and learnings comprising the Byrning Platform create an Office Playbook for Personal Development that engenders equal office access for all.</p>
    
      <p>With each article, I’ll publish a tool or tipsheet designed to help anyone facing career challenges. <strong>YOUR continued critical feedback, personal anecdotes, and practical applications all help improve the content.</strong> Please continue to send your thoughts for how we can apply the material and make a difference.</p>
    
      <p>Thanks for being on the platform – now let’s take the leap.</p>
